Write a Python program that prompts the user to input 3 numbers, one at a time. The Python program should put the numbers in a list, sort the list, and print the sorted list. Executing the program should produce results something like this:

Enter a number:

5

Enter a number:

4

Enter a number:

3

3, 4, 5

>>>

Turn in your source code and a screenshot showing a full execution of your program and the result that it prints to the screen. In the execution that you take a screenshot of, you should enter the numbers in non-sorted order so that we can tell that sorting did occur.

Hints:

Hints:

1. Python lists have a built-in sort() method that you could use.
2. The input() function will accept input from the user at the command line.ython lists have a built-in sort() method that you could use.
